## Programming Assignment: Image Segmentation with U-Net

# Coursera - Convolution Neural Networks

Week 3 / assignment: 2 

Welcome to the final assignment of Week 3 in Course 4 of the Deep Learning Specialization! You'll be building your own U-Net, a type of CNN designed for quick, precise image segmentation, and using it to predict a label for every single pixel in an image - in this case, an image from a self-driving car dataset.
