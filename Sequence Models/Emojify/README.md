## Programming Assignment: Emojify

# Coursera - Sequence Models

Week 2 / assignment: 2 

Welcome to the second assignment of Week 2, Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization! You're going to use word vector representations to build two Emojifiers: the first will be a baseline model using pre-trainedword embeddings, and the second will be a more sophisticated version using an LSTM! 🤩 💫 🔥

You'll implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (⚾️).
