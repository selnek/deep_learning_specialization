## Programming Assignment: Neural Machine Translation

# Coursera - Sequence Models

Week 3 / assignment: 1 

Welcome to your first programming assignment for this week!

You will build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine-readable dates ("2009-06-25").
You will do this using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models.
This notebook was produced together with NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute.
