## Programming Assignment: Operations on Word Vectors - Debiasing

# Coursera - Sequence Models

Week 2 / assignment: 1 

Welcome to your first assignment of Week 2, Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization!

Because word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train, most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings. In this notebook you'll try your hand at loading, measuring similarity between, and modifying pre-trained embeddings.

At the end of this notebook you'll have a chance to try an optional exercise, where you'll modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias. Reducing bias is an important consideration in ML and NLP, so you're encouraged to take this challenge!
