## Programming Assignment: Transformers Architecture with TensorFlow

# Coursera - Sequence Models

Week 4 / assignment: 1 

Earlier in the course, you've implemented sequential neural networks such as RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs. In this notebook you'll explore the Transformer architecture, a neural network that takes advantage of parallel processing and allows you to substantially speed up the training process.
