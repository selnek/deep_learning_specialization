## Programming Assignment: Trigger Word Detection

# Coursera - Sequence Models

Week 3 / assignment: 2 

Welcome to the second (required) programming assignment in Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization!

In this assignment, you'll construct a speech dataset from synthesized data and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wake word detection). Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri to wake up upon hearing a certain word. At the end of this assignment, you'll be able to record a clip of yourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying "activate."
